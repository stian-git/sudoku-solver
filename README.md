## Description

I started working on this Sudoku-solver during the spring 2022. I wanted to experience how I can translate the way I think while solving a Sudoku into code.

Solving a sudoku is done by using several different methods/rules. My solver got some of these rules implemented, but more rules need to be added to make it complete. The current version can solve most easy and medium leveled Sudokus.

My plan is also to implement a log showing the last steps, both manual and auto steps, and step back if needed.

- Use your own game
- Play manually
- Let the game help you
- Error Indication
- Rotate the view
